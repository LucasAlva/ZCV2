enforce_neutrality_belgium_desc;After signing the Treaty of London in 1839, Belgian neutrality was guaranteed by the great powers of Great Britain, France , the Russian Empire, Austria, and Prussia. With this, Belgium was also forbidden from becoming engaged in military conflicts similar to the Swiss and Swedish. Neutrality was only broken by the German Schlieffen plan during the First World War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

reform_vlp_desc;Our Viceroyalty in the River Plate is severely underpopulated. Yet it has come to our attention that our colonial rivals have set up succesful settlement colonies in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Far East. With a little bit of help, we too can exploit the immense potential present in the Rio de La Plata.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

cleanse_pampas_title;Cleanse the Pampas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
cleanse_pampas_desc;The provinces of the River Plate have returned to Spanish rule. Much has changed since then. But one concern continues to loom over our citizens, the indigenous peoples. In the pampas, native american raids are a comon occurrence, and the same is true in patagonia. However, subjugation to the Spanish Empire has its perks. The Spanish crown has arranged the resources necessary to resettle the indigenous population in the Tierra del Fuego. Although opposition exists in our country, this policy has been successfully carried out by the United States some time ago. Let us too cleanse our nation and bring the light of civilization to the River Plate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,

general_east_africa_company_desc;The Society for  $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonization has been attempting to colonize the Zanzibar coast for several years now, having formed the  $COUNTRY_ADJ$ East Africa company and signed several treaties with Swahili tribes. It now seems they are facing difficulty with rebellions and have asked us to step in. The Sultan of Zanzibar will doubtlessly object if we do, as he claims authority over the coast -- even if his actual authority is minimal -- but so what if he does? This may be an interesting opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
